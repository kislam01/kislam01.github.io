							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>
							I am a sophomore from the small city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, currently studying at Tufts University. I am majoring in Computer Science in the School of Engineering here at Tufts and I have a deep interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Besides academics, I am an avid fan of soccer and my favorite team is Manchester United. I am also an aspiring musician with a great knack for playing the acoustic guitar.
